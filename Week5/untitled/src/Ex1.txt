// ◦ declare a private constant  double variable PI has value
//of 3,141519
// ◦ declare a private variable called radius.
// ◦ class constructor will have an argument to set radius.
// ◦ declare a method called computeArea() to compute area
//of a circle object.
// ◦ create 3 different circle instances, with radiuses 5, 10,
